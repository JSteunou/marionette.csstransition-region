marionette.csstransition-region
===============================

A Marionette Region for CSS transitions / animation

Another approach of Transition with Marionette Region. Heavily inspired by [@jmeas](https://github.com/jmeas/marionette.transition-region) but for a different workflow, where animation are handle in CSS3 rather than in JS because sometime you prefer let the CSS guy handle the view look and feel as he likes it and change it with ease.

**Warning**: This is rough and it uses not yet published Marionette v2.2
